                <p>Hello, I am Muhammad Tarek Mahmud Rashik, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science
                    and Engineering (CSE) at the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB). For a long time, I have
                    been an enthusiast of art and since I was introduced to web design I started to slowly commit myself
                    to it until it became a hobby. By 2019 I was able to launch my first website Urban Era and it has
                    been fully functional since then, it is something I am proud of, but this is just the start of my
                    journey and I am hoping on working with bigger projects.
                </p>
